This project was an effort to explore asynchronous Javascript and data serialization across multiple platforms. To that end, I developed a web-app using Flask, a Python-based web microframework, which serves location data collected from a simple iPhone app. This data is stored in an SQL database and is visualized in real time on the web app through the Google Maps API, with color denoting the age of the data. See below for a small example of data collected from a BART ride from Oakland to Berkeley.
